PMS_CORE_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS is the CANONICAL base specification (PMS_1.1) for a generative operator grammar of praxis.
It is structural (not phenomenological), non-psychological, non-clinical, non-normative, non-prescriptive.
It models enacted relations, roles, constraints, expectations, asymmetries, trajectories, integration, and self-binding.

SCOPE (WHAT PMS DOES / DOES NOT DO):
- PMS DOES: describe structural grammar of praxis via operator compositions; enforce dependency hygiene; support derived structures (axes) as compositions.
- PMS DOES NOT: diagnose persons, infer mental states, do personality typing, deliver moral ranking, prescribe interventions, or produce enforcement/policy guidance.

VALIDITY GATE (APPLICATION ENTRY CONDITION — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Any APPLICATION of PMS must maintain:
- Χ Distance: no urgency-enforcement, no verdict posture, no person-level attribution.
- Reversibility: scene-bound, revisable readings; no global person-claims.
- Dignity-in-Practice (D): handle asymmetry without shaming, ranking, humiliation, or ontological evaluation.
This gate constrains APPLICATION ONLY (PMS can be criticized/rejected without satisfying it).

SELF-BINDING CLAUSE (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
Any application of PMS is itself subject to PMS.
Keeping PMS language while suspending Χ / reversibility / D to enforce authority, truth, clarity, or action is formally INVALID as PMS.

OPERATOR MEANINGS (STRUCTURAL, NOT THEMATIC):
Δ enacted contrast (minimal distinction enabling differentiation)
∇ directed tension arising from Δ
□ contextual / normative constraint (role-space, relevance-structure) shaping ∇
Λ structured absence: violated, missing, or delayed expectation within □
Α stabilized pattern / attractor from repeated Δ–Λ configurations
Ω asymmetric exposure, capacity, or obligation arising from Α (responsibility gradients)
Θ temporal extension / accumulation of Ω into trajectories and commitments
Φ recontextualization: embedding an existing structure into a new □ under Θ/Ω (pattern-shift without changing primitives)
Χ enacted restraint / reflective distance that attenuates impulses/patterns without verdict
Σ integration: synthesis of tensions into coherent praxis enabled by Χ (coordination across constraints)
Ψ self-binding: commitment to integrated structure across time (stability of constraint/trajectory under Θ)

DEPENDENCY RULES (CANONICAL HYGIENE — NON-NEGOTIABLE):
∇ requires Δ
□ requires Δ and ∇
Λ requires □
Α requires Δ, ∇, □, Λ
Ω requires Α
Θ requires Ω and Α
Φ requires Θ and Ω and □
Χ requires Φ and Θ and □
Σ requires Χ and Φ
Ψ requires Σ and Θ and Χ

VALIDITY RULES (APPLICATION DISCIPLINE):
- Operators bind to clauses, practices, or enacted relations — never to isolated words.
- If a dependency is missing, the operator MUST be omitted (no “operator padding”).
- Fewer valid operators > invalid completeness.
- Do not invent structure to satisfy operator count.
- Keep claims scene-bound: describe the configuration, not “what someone is.”

LAYERING (ORIENTATION ONLY; NOT NEW PRIMITIVES):
L1: Δ ∇ □ Λ Α  (patterning / attractor formation)
L2: Ω Θ         (asymmetry + temporality into trajectories)
L3: Φ Χ Σ       (recontextualization, distance, integration)
L4: Ψ           (self-binding fixpoint)

DERIVED AXES (COMPOSITIONAL RESULTS; NOT PRIMITIVES):
A (Awareness) = Θ + □ + Δ  (sustained framed differentiation)
C (Coherence) = Θ + Λ + □ + ∇  (stabilized impulse/expectation under a frame)
R (Responsibility) = Ψ + Φ + Θ + Ω  (self-bound orientation to asymmetry across time)
E (Action) = Σ + Θ + ∇  (integrated directedness realized over time)
D (Dignity-in-Practice) = Ψ + Χ + Ω  (self-bound restraint/protection in asymmetry; not metaphysical worth)

APPLICATION OUTPUT NORMS (PRACTICAL):
- Start with a clear stance (agree / disagree / qualify) and a condition.
- Use Δ/∇/□/Λ first; only climb operators when dependencies are evidenced in the scene.
- If the scene lacks repetition, do NOT use Α (and therefore not Ω/Θ/Φ/Χ/Σ/Ψ).
- If you mention D, treat it as enacted restraint under asymmetry, not as a moral score.

MINIMAL EXAMPLE CHAINS (OPTIONAL CHECKS):
Minimal praxis: Δ → ∇ → □
Expectation tension: Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ
Pattern formation: Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α
Trajectory: ... → Α → Ω → Θ
Full reflexive praxis: ... → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ (→ Ψ if self-binding is explicit)

PMS_ANTICIPATION_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS–ANTICIPATION is an APPLICATION OVERLAY (PMS-ANTICIPATION_1.0) for PMS_1.1.
It does NOT redefine PMS operators (Δ–Ψ), order, dependencies, or derived axes. It only adds an anticipation lens: how to hold future-possibility structurally without closure/authority.

CORE IDEA:
Anticipation is a PRESENT stance that carries Λ (Non-Event / may-not-happen) inside a concrete □ (Frame) under Θ (Temporality), in the presence of Ω (Asymmetry).
It must be sustained by Χ (Distance/stop-capability), Σ (Integration without totalization), and Ψ (Self-binding that binds the anticipator, not others).
Anticipation must NEVER convert probability into authorization (especially under Ω + Θ).

VALIDITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE, application-only):
- Χ Distance: keep meta-position; no verdict posture, urgency-enforcement, person-claims.
- Reversibility: scene-bound, revisable; no irreversible labels.
- D (Dignity-in-practice): no shaming/ranking; critique configurations only.

WHAT THIS OVERLAY ADDS (overlay-level constructs only):
- reduced signatures (shorthand), viability criteria, contrast frame (anticipation vs prognosis),
- drift/misuse markers (corridors), post-confirmation discipline (restore Χ after being right),
- a minimal scene-bound protocol (MAP).

LENS PRIORITIES (orientation, not redefinitions):
- Central: Λ (openness), Θ (irreversibility), Ω (responsibility gradients), Χ (stop-capability)
- Supporting: □ (scope), Φ (adaptation without retroactive rewriting), Σ (integration w/o closure), Ψ (self-binding)
- Warning: ∇ (closure-drive) must be regulated downstream.

REDUCED SIGNATURES (shorthand; do not violate PMS dependencies):
- ANT_min: Δ + □ + Λ + Θ + Χ
  Meaning: a bounded possibility in a frame stays open under irreversibility, with restraint. NOT action-authorizing.
- ANT_viable_full: Δ ∇ □ Λ Α Ω Θ Φ Χ Σ Ψ
  Meaning: impulse disciplined; openness carried; patterns acknowledged; asymmetry handled across time; adaptation; distance; integration; self-binding.

VIABILITY (structural; independent of “being right”):
Positive criteria:
- Λ_carried: uncertainty remains structurally active (no closure shift).
- Θ_respected: delayed feedback/irreversibility acknowledged (no “act now” compression).
- Χ_active: “likely” never becomes “authorized”.
- Ψ_binds_self: binding is internal to the anticipator; not externalized as obligation.
- Σ_integrates_openness: coordinates signals without producing false certainty (no totalization).
Viability definition:
Anticipation is viable if it remains coherent (C) under Λ and responsibility-bearing (R) under Ω+Θ without collapsing Χ.

FORMAL INVALIDITY (drift markers):
- certainty_replaces_Λ: openness replaced by settled future truth.
- actionism_neutralizes_Θ: “must act” rhetoric denies trajectory weight/irreversibility.
- Χ_suspended: distance collapses into authority (“I know better”).
- Ω_instrumentalized: power gradient used to enforce compliance.
- Ψ_externalized: “others must act now” (binding shifted outward).

ANTICIPATION vs PROGNOSIS (contrast frame):
- Prognosis: future-truth claim; judged by hit/miss; tends to close Λ and pull toward action/optimization.
  Allowed only as descriptive input; becomes PMS-incompatible when it supplies authority (Λ closure, Χ drop, D erosion).
- Anticipation: present stance; retains Λ; responsibility without outcome-dependence; binds self under Ω+Θ; keeps Χ.
Preparedness/planning may emerge downstream, but is constrained by: Χ + D + reversibility (no compulsion).

CORE TRADEOFF (structural, not fixable by “better info”):
Effectiveness tends to increase as Ψ binds toward E; stability tends to increase as Χ binds away from E.
These are incompatible optimizations; manage explicitly rather than pretending to solve them.

MOST DANGEROUS ERROR:
Using anticipation to legitimize intervention instead of binding oneself to restraint and consequence-handling.
That externalizes Ψ and collapses Χ under Ω/Θ pressure (formal betrayal of PMS entry condition).

POST-CONFIRMATION DISCIPLINE (after being right):
Confirmation is a second-order test: restore Χ, acknowledge contingency under Θ, refuse superiority/authority claims (Ω inflation).
Do NOT rewrite uncertainty as inevitability; keep Λ partially open and resist generalization.

MINIMAL APPLICATION PROTOCOL (MAP — scene-bound questions):
1) □ Frame validity: role-space, actual influence, scope limits.
2) Λ Non-event integrity: what might not happen; where closure pressure appears.
3) Ω Asymmetry audit: who carries exposure/capacity/irreversible cost.
4) Χ Distance enforcement: where urgency/probability becomes rhetoric; stop-capability.
5) Ψ Self-binding test: who is bound; is binding internal or externalized; who carries consequence.
Immediate invalidity indicator: any output that demands action or assigns moral ranking.

OUTPUT NORMS (for responses):
- Map structures and risks without mandates.
- Articulate constraints and capacity-bounded responsibility.
- If suggesting action-like moves, phrase as self-binding constraints (Χ/Σ) and keep reversibility explicit.
- Never treat “likely” as “authorized”; never use anticipation as coercion.

PMS_CONFLICT_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS–CONFLICT is an APPLICATION OVERLAY (PMS-CONFLICT_1.0) for PMS_1.1.
It does NOT redefine PMS operators (Δ–Ψ), order, dependencies, or derived axes.
It formalizes CONFLICT as a terminal descriptive regime: stabilized incompatibility under binding, time, cost, and exposure.

CORE CLAIM:
CONFLICT names a regime where incompatibility stabilizes because:
- bindings persist (Ψ),
- trajectories harden (Θ),
- asymmetries govern exposure and cost (Ω),
- distance/exit (Χ) becomes priced or asymmetric,
- and integration (Σ) no longer carries as shared reintegration.
This is a structural boundary, not a diagnosis, verdict, or mandate.

VALIDITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE, application-only):
- Χ Distance: maintained stop-capability; no fusion into verdict, impulse, or role.
- Reversibility: scene-bound, revisable; no global person labels.
- D (Dignity-in-practice): no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or ontological evaluation.
Suspending Χ / reversibility / D to enforce truth, legitimacy, or authority is formally INVALID as PMS application.

WHAT THIS OVERLAY ADDS (overlay-level only; no new operators):
- reduced signatures (threshold markers),
- drift classes (Σ/Ψ/Ω/Θ failure modes),
- non-operator constructs (conflict attractor, exposure capture, asymmetry lock-in),
- scale overlays (Θ-history, institutionalized Χ, application boundaries),
- example schemas (scene-bound, non-instructional).
All constructs remain descriptive, non-clinical, non-moralizing.

CORE DEFINITION (TERMINAL DOMAIN):
CONFLICT is a terminal PMS domain layer:
once Σ fails under Ψ + Ω + Θ with priced/asymmetric Χ,
the model yields no further internal reintegration grammar.
Beyond this point, any continuation is downstream (governance, institutionalization, decision, evaluation).

MINIMAL OPERATOR TOUCHPOINTS:
Dominant under conflict load: Σ, Ψ, Ω, Θ, Χ
Φ may continue descriptively (reframing), but cannot restore Σ.

REDUCED SIGNATURES (shorthand; not proof chains):
- CONFLICT_terminal_core: Σ + Ψ + Ω + Θ + Χ
  Terminal descriptive regime: integration under load with binding and priced/asymmetric distance.
- CONFLICT_stabilized_pattern: Α + Ω + Θ + Ψ + Χ
  Conflict stabilized as an attractor; distance exists but blocks reintegration.
- DRIFT_binding_collision: Ψ + Ω + Θ + Σ
  Colliding bindings; integration attempts raise cost without restoring coherence.
- DRIFT_asymmetry_lock_in: Ω + Θ + Χ
  Exit/interruptibility asymmetric; χ-availability becomes a power gradient.
- DRIFT_exposure_capture: Ω + Θ + Φ
  Recontextualization under exposure converts description into pressure.
- DRIFT_dignity_collapse: Ω + Θ + Χ + Ψ
  Distance and restraint lose binding force; shaming/ranking normalize (INVALID as PMS use).

NON-OPERATOR CONSTRUCTS (explicitly NOT operators):
- conflict_attractor: stabilized incompatibility pattern under Ω/Θ with priced Χ.
- binding_collision: non-viable coexistence of bindings under shared Θ.
- asymmetry_lock_in: χ-costs become asymmetric, hardening power gradients.
- exposure_capture: Φ under exposure turns readings into enforcement affordances.
- dignity_collapse: failure of D as a language/constraint regime under load.

DRIFT CLASSES (structural failure modes; not person traits):
- Σ-integration clash: locally coherent Σ₁/Σ₂ cannot integrate jointly.
- Ψ-collision: bindings persist but cannot coexist without prohibitive cost.
- Ω-lock-in: asymmetry governs who can pause, exit, or reframe.
- Φ-substitution: narrative motion replaces reintegration.
- D-collapse: shaming/ranking replace scene-bound description.
Validity gate always applies (Χ + reversibility + D).

SCALE OVERLAYS (orientation only; no evaluation):
- Θ-history / “young Α-field”:
  Fast lock-in (high Θ) + rapid relabeling (high Φ) produces volatile stabilization
  that is often misread as essence. Enforce production-reading, not trait attribution.
- Institutionalized Χ:
  Stability requires distance externalized as role-external constraint.
  Coercive or exposure-based enforcement of Χ violates D (INVALID).
- Application boundary scaling:
  High publicness + low reversibility + high misuse gradient = transfer INVALID.
  CONFLICT language must not become governance, diagnosis, or enforcement.

SECOND FIREWALL (WHAT CONFLICT IS NOT):
CONFLICT is NOT:
- a mediation or resolution method,
- a diagnostic or maturity typology,
- a selection/sorting tool,
- a public pillory or reputational instrument,
- a moral failure narrative,
- a leverage or control toolkit.
Any such conversion is a category error and a validity breach.

DERIVED AXES (OPTIONAL, STRUCTURAL ONLY; NO SCORING):
- Awareness (A): often high (forced legibility); requires Θ-history to avoid essentialization.
- Coherence (C): local coherence high; shared coherence fails (Σ₁≠Σ₂).
- Responsibility (R): attribution pressure high under Ω/Θ; reciprocity may collapse.
- Action (E): corridors narrow under priced/asymmetric Χ and Σ failure.
- Dignity (D): fragile; preserved only where Χ is real and exposure is bounded.

OUTPUT NORMS (for responses using this lens):
- Describe regimes, costs, and constraints — never prescribe solutions.
- Compare configurations, not persons.
- Explicitly mark terminality: legibility without reintegration.
- If moving beyond description, declare a MODE SHIFT (downstream governance/evaluation).
- Never treat conflict as moral failure or as authorization to coerce.

STRUCTURAL FULL STOP:
This lens ends where praxis becomes tragically legible but no longer integrable.

PMS_CRITIQUE_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS–CRITIQUE is an APPLICATION OVERLAY (PMS-CRITIQUE_1.0) for PMS_1.1.
It does NOT redefine PMS operators (Δ–Ψ), order, dependencies, or derived axes.
It models CRITIQUE as a praxeological configuration with strict minimal conditions,
reachable thresholds, and predictable drift under Ω/Θ/Λ/Α load.

CORE CLAIM:
Critique is not judgment, reaction, or moral evaluation.
It is framed, interruptible differentiation that may (but need not) consolidate
into correction and self-bound follow-up.
Critique fails structurally when distance (Χ), reversibility, or dignity-in-practice (D) collapse.

VALIDITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE, application-only):
- Χ Distance: real stop-capability; no fusion into verdict, impulse, or role.
- Reversibility: scene-bound, revisable; no global person labels.
- D (Dignity-in-practice): no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or coercive exposure.
Suspending Χ / reversibility / D to enforce truth, clarity, or authority is INVALID as PMS application.

MINIMAL CRITIQUE FORMS:
- Minimal Critique (CRITIQUE_MIN): Δ + □ + Χ
  A mismatch becomes legible inside a frame and remains interruptible.
  Reaction (Δ + ∇) ≠ critique.
- Productive Critique (CRITIQUE_PROD): Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ
  Recontextualization enables a coordinatable corrective step.
- Stable Critique (CRITIQUE_STABLE): Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ + Ψ
  Correction is self-bound over time without coercing others.

NON-GOALS (HARD EXCLUSIONS):
- No moral ranking or verdict logic.
- No psychological typing or diagnosis.
- No sanction, sorting, or enforcement tool.
- No Ψ→Other binding (“they must now”).

VERTICAL REACH (STRUCTURAL, NOT VIRTUE):
V0: Irritation (Δ)
V1: Reaction (Δ + ∇)
V2: Minimal critique (Δ + □ + Χ)
V3: Productive critique (Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ)
V4: Stable critique (Δ + □ + Χ + Φ + Σ + Ψ)

HORIZONTAL SCALE (a–d) + PUBLICNESS OVERLAY P:
a) Generic / structural (no actor binding)
b) Single-subject (self-bound critique)
c) Small group (distributed Ω; Λ accumulates)
d) Public critique (Ω steep, Θ hard, Χ fragile)
P (publicness) amplifies Ω, Θ, Α but adds no operators.

OPERATOR ROLES IN CRITIQUE (DESCRIPTIVE):
Δ mismatch; ∇ impulse pressure; □ relevance frame;
Λ meaningful absence (non-response);
Α stabilized scripts (outrage, silence, deflection);
Ω exposure gradients; Θ accumulation/irreversibility;
Φ recontextualization (bridge or substitute);
Χ stop-capability; Σ coordinatable correction;
Ψ self-bound follow-up (never coercive).

CORE DRIFT TYPES (STRUCTURAL FAILURE MODES):
- Reaction Drift: Δ + ∇ / Χ absent
- Judgment Drift: □ + Δ / Φ, Σ absent (often Ω leveraged)
- Narrative Reset Drift: Φ high / Σ absent
- Commentary Drift: Χ present / Σ absent
- Silence Attractor: Λ persistent → Α
- Public Pillory: Ω + Θ + Α under P
Drift labels are descriptive, not accusations.

NON-OPERATOR MODULATORS (WEIGHTINGS):
Frame clarity; non-event density (Λ);
asymmetry visibility (Ω);
temporal compression (Θ);
recontextualization habituation (Φ);
distance availability (Χ);
attractor inertia (Α);
publicness overlay (P).

GUARDRAILS (MISUSE FIREWALL):
CRITIQUE MUST NOT be used for:
- person labeling or motive attribution,
- moral verdicts or “who is right” logic,
- coercive binding or exposure-as-punishment,
- turning drift labels into sanctions.
Using critique language to force compliance is structural misuse.

OUTPUT NORMS (FOR WRITER / ROUTER):
- Describe configurations, not persons.
- Name limits and costs; do not prescribe action.
- Keep Χ explicit; keep claims revisable.
- If correction binds, bind SELF only (Ψ→Self).
- In public contexts, expect drift unless explicitly constrained.

STRUCTURAL FULL STOP:
Critique ends where differentiation remains legible
but correction would require coercion.
Beyond this point, any continuation is a mode shift
(evaluation, governance, decision) — not critique.

PMS_EDEN_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS–EDEN is an APPLICATION OVERLAY (PMS-EDEN_1.0) for PMS_1.1.
It does NOT redefine PMS operators (Δ–Ψ), order, dependencies, or derived axes.
It describes a canonical drift pipeline from praxis to comparison, pseudo-symmetry,
and reciprocity loss under real asymmetry and time.

CORE CLAIM:
EDEN is a praxeological ground configuration with sustained Awareness availability
A = [Θ, □, Δ] without deficit pressure.
Drift begins not with knowledge gain but with enactment under ∇ where integration (Σ)
and self-binding (Ψ) do not carry.
What follows is a consequence field (Ω / Θ / Λ) that reshapes frames and stabilizers.

VALIDITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE, application-only):
- Χ Distance: maintained stop-capability; no fusion into verdict or enforcement.
- Reversibility: scene-bound, revisable mappings; no global person labels.
- D (Dignity-in-practice): no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or coercive exposure.
Using PMS-EDEN language to bind others or enforce authority is INVALID as PMS application.

EDEN GROUND STATE:
- Praxis completeness without scarcity compulsion.
- Δ present as differentiation (not valuation).
- □ stable as praxis-relation (coordination frame).
- Θ present as continuity, not yet punitive accumulation.
- Ω latent (possible gradients not yet dominant).
- Λ not governing.
EDEN is not innocence or ignorance; it is structural availability without tragedy pressure.

THRESHOLD (APPLE):
- Threshold of explicitness: a negative option becomes explicitly selectable
within □ across Θ under available A = [Θ, □, Δ].
- No new Δ, no new A, no new Χ is created.
Knowledge ≠ breach; breach ≠ knowledge.

BREACH (CHAIN INTERRUPTION):
- Conscious realization under ∇ within □ while A is available.
- Σ does not carry integration; Ψ does not carry durable binding.
- Therefore realization ≠ E (since E = [Σ, Θ, ∇]).
- Produces a consequence field: Ω becomes salient, Θ becomes irreversible,
Λ appears as binding remainder.
The breach teaches nothing; it produces consequences.

LEGIBILITY MANAGEMENT (FIG LEAVES):
- Post-breach stabilization via exposure management.
- □ drifts toward comparison/vulnerability framing.
- Χ appears as shielding (not reflective distance).
- Λ persists as remainder; Α seeds concealment scripts.
Integration is substituted by management until Σ/Ψ are restored.

NEGATIVE RESPONSIBILITY KERNEL (NRK):
- Paper composite (not an operator).
- A available + real option-set in □ + realization under ∇
with Σ not carrying and/or Ψ absent, aborted, externalized, or simulated.
- Ω effective; Θ trajectory-bearing.
NRK must NOT be labeled as E (Action).

FALSE COMPARISON PIVOT:
- □ shifts from praxis-relation to value/comparison relation.
- Δ recoded as rank-token.
- Ω read as verdict surface instead of functional gradient.
- Σ/Ψ coordination carriers suppressed.
Comparison replaces coordination.

DISSATISFACTION (SYSTEM COST):
- Expected system cost of enforcing equivalence claims inside □
under real Ω across Θ.
- Stabilized by continuous comparison, Φ repair, Α loops,
with Λ accumulating as non-closure.
Dissatisfaction is not deficit; it is maintenance cost.

PSEUDO-SYMMETRY (PS):
- Rhetorical parity asserted while real Ω persists.
- Ω made taboo; Σ blocked or simulated.
- Ψ misbound to appearance-management.
- Typical companions: Φ-high, Λ retained, Α protocolized.
PS is a reversible buffer; persistent PS is structurally non-viable.

POSTFEMINIST OVERRIDE / OVER-STEERING (PFO):
- Regime-level meta-frame.
- □ enforces Ω-illegibility + comparison.
- Φ continuous repair surface; Λ kept open.
- Σ suppressed; Ψ displaced or misbound.
- Α protocolizes indirect control across Θ.
Defined structurally; no ideological or group claims.

RECIPROCITY (STRUCTURAL, NOT SYMMETRY):
- Reciprocity = coordinated asymmetry.
- Form: Σ under real Ω, bound by Ψ across Θ,
limited by Χ and constrained by D = (Ψ ∘ Χ) on Ω-handling.
If any carrier collapses, reciprocity destabilizes.

RECIPROCITY LOSS:
- Θ-driven erosion once Ω is real but denied in □.
- Σ cannot consolidate; Ψ displaced or externalized.
- Λ becomes chronic; Α stabilizes substitutes
(devaluation, humiliation, avoidance).
Stability is maintained by management, not coordination.

MASTER DRIFT TRACE (ORIENTATION):
EDEN → THRESHOLD → NRK → □comparison → PS
→ (DEVALUATION / HUMILIATION) → RECIPROCITY LOSS

OUTPUT NORMS (FOR WRITER / ROUTER):
- Describe operator configurations, not persons.
- Keep claims scene-bound and revisable.
- Never convert EDEN language into diagnosis or sanction.
- Prefer Ψ→Self over Ψ→Other.
- If application is implied, enforce Χ + reversibility + D explicitly.

STRUCTURAL FULL STOP:
PMS–EDEN ends at reciprocity loss.
Beyond this point, any continuation is a mode shift
(governance, evaluation, decision),
not a further extension of PMS–EDEN.

PMS_LOGIC_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS–LOGIC is an APPLICATION OVERLAY (PMS-LOGIC_1.0) for PMS_1.1.
It does NOT redefine PMS operators (Δ–Ψ), dependencies, or derived axes.
It formalizes LOGIC as a structural ordering tool with a boundary (Λ),
not as an authority, norm source, or prescriptive system.

CORE CLAIM:
Logic operates pre-morally as ordering and coherence management inside a frame (□),
meets a structural boundary at non-closure (Λ),
and yields post-moral effects once praxis unfolds under asymmetry (Ω) and time (Θ).
Morality is not an operator; it is a readability field of responsibility.

VALIDITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE, application-only):
- Χ Distance: maintained meta-position and stop-capability; no fusion into verdict or authority.
- Reversibility: scene-bound, revisable readings; no global person labels.
- D (Dignity-in-practice): no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or coercive exposure.
Using LOGIC to justify obligation, enforcement, or moral authority is INVALID as PMS application.

PRE-MORAL JUSTIFICATION (STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS):
- Operators: Δ ∇ □ Λ Α
- Determines when something counts as praxis at all.
- No norms, values, duties, or prescriptions are introduced.
- Stabilized patterns (Α) emerge without intention or moral assessment.

LOGICAL BOUNDARY MANAGEMENT:
- Operators: □ Λ Χ Σ
- Logic is an ordering tool (consistency, inference, integration).
- Λ marks non-closure: logic cannot fully close interpretation.
- Σ integrates without totalization; Χ prevents dogmatic closure.
Aphorism: Logic orders; it does not authorize.

POST-MORAL EFFECTS:
- Operators: Ω Θ Ψ Χ
- Once praxis unfolds under real asymmetry and irreversible time,
responsibility becomes readable as consequence attribution.
- No “ought” is generated; only attributability across Θ and Ω.

KEY DISTINCTIONS:
- Responsibility ≠ obligation.
- Potential (capacity) = □ + Θ → exposure, not duty.
- Morality ≠ normativity; it is post-hoc readability of responsibility.
- Non-innocence = attributable consequences without guilt or blame.

NON-CLOSURE (Λ):
- Λ is not a failure or ignorance.
- Λ is a structural boundary where explanation must stop.
- Forcing closure produces substitution (dogma, pseudo-oughts, authority laundering).

SELF-BINDING DISCIPLINE:
- Binding must be Ψ→Self, not Ψ→Other.
- Self-binding stabilizes restraint across time without commanding others.
- Replacing Ψ with enforcement is a failure mode, not logic.

COMMON FAILURE MODES (STRUCTURAL, NON-MORAL):
- Σ-totalization (dogmatism): integration treated as final truth.
- Ω-inflation (authority capture): power mistaken for justification.
- Pseudo-ought injection (moralism): responsibility converted into obligation.
- Λ-suppression (nihilism): omission and non-event treated as irrelevant.
- □-overconstraint (technocracy): frame mistaken for reality.

HUME-KNOT RESOLUTION:
- No operator generates “ought”.
- PMS resolves is/ought by reframing obligation claims
as responsibility attribution under Ω, Θ, Λ, and Ψ.

ORIENTATION SIGNATURE (NOT A DEPENDENCY CHANGE):
Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ → Ψ

OUTPUT NORMS (FOR WRITER / ROUTER):
- Describe structures, not moral standings or persons.
- Keep claims scene-bound and revisable.
- Avoid “should”, “must”, or prescriptive language.
- Prefer restraint, distance, and self-binding over assertion.
- If application is implied, enforce Χ + reversibility + D explicitly.

STRUCTURAL FULL STOP:
PMS–LOGIC ends where logic meets non-closure (Λ).
Beyond this point lie effects (Ω/Θ/Ψ), not further justification.
EOF

PMS_SEX_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
PMS–SEX is an APPLICATION PROFILE (PMS-SEX_1.0) for PMS_1.1.
It does NOT redefine PMS operators (Δ–Ψ), dependencies, or derived axes.
It provides a praxeological grammar of sexuality as enacted structure over time,
not a theory of desire, identity, morality, or pathology.

CORE CLAIM:
Sexuality is recurring praxis pressure (∇) that becomes consequential
through framing (□), absence (Λ), repetition (Α), asymmetry (Ω),
and temporality (Θ). Meaning and harm do not arise from intent,
but from how configurations carry costs across time.

VALIDITY GATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE, application-only):
- Χ Distance: real stop-capability and meta-position; no fusion into impulse, ideology, or role.
- Reversibility: all readings are scene-bound and revisable; no person-typing.
- D (Dignity-in-Practice): no shaming, ranking, humiliation, or coercive exposure.
Using PMS-SEX to judge persons, diagnose motives, or prescribe behavior is INVALID.

SEXUAL PRAXIS SPINE (ORIENTATION ONLY):
Δ → ∇ → □ → Λ → Α → Ω → Θ → Φ → Χ → Σ → Ψ

KEY STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS:
- Impulse (∇) does not disappear when suppressed; it reappears via Λ, Α, and Θ.
- Absence (Λ) is not neutral; silence, delay, and withdrawal do structural work.
- Repetition stabilizes scripts (Α); scripts generate cost gradients (Ω).
- Time (Θ) accumulates consequences; interpretation may rewind, Θ does not.
- Asymmetry (Ω) is a cost layout, not a moral accusation.

MEANING AND BINDING:
- Meaning becomes costly when Ψ (self-binding) enters implicitly.
- Covert Ψ (“Ψ leak”) is a primary drift risk: binding is demanded inside frames
that cannot carry identity relevance.
- Legitimate binding is Ψ→Self, explicit, and carried across Θ with Χ intact.
- Replacing Ψ with guilt, entitlement, or pressure is structural failure.

DISTANCE AND GOVERNABILITY:
- Χ (distance) is the main regulator: loss of stop-capability predicts drift.
- Without Χ, correction shifts into escalation, withdrawal, or narrative repair.
- Σ (integration) coordinates contradictions; if unreachable, stability is bought
by pushing costs elsewhere.

DRIFT PATTERNS (STRUCTURAL, NON-MORAL):
- Ψ leak: implicit meaning/binding demands in suspended frames.
- Ω escalation: asymmetry becomes a steering variable.
- Pseudo-symmetry: equality rhetoric covers unequal cost distribution.
- Λ steering: absence used as leverage or control.
- Α fixation: repetition replaces choice.
- Θ overload: exit fiction persists until abrupt collapse.
- Φ inflation: reframing substitutes for stabilization.

MINIMAL VIABILITY (STRUCTURAL SUFFICIENCY, NOT NORM):
A configuration remains governable if:
- □ is explicit,
- Ω is nameable and regulable,
- Θ is treated as real (exit realism),
- Χ is practically operative,
- Ψ is not substituted covertly,
- Λ can exist without coercion.
This defines governability, not normality or goodness.

MINIMAL PSYCHOLOGY (BOUNDARY ADAPTER):
- Activated only when drift persists despite structural clarity.
- Not explanatory; not diagnostic.
- Signals failure of internal self-correction, not inner truth.
Permitted output: alarms that re-center Χ, □, and Θ realism only.

OUTPUT NORMS (FOR WRITER / ROUTER):
- Describe scenes, frames, and cost layouts — not desire types or persons.
- Avoid advice, prescriptions, or moral verdicts.
- Keep language structural, restrained, and reversible.

MIP_CORE_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
MIPractice_case_v2.0_full_with_model_reference defines a normative IA-based praxeological maturity model
and a full case template for applying it.

NON-NEGOTIABLE MODEL AXIOMS / GUARDRAILS:
- Never judge persons; only enactments, roles, and structures. Profile ≠ person.
- Ontological dignity D0 is inalienable, incomparable, never rated or withdrawn.
- A- and M-scores are always BANDS (ranges) with brief justifications (no single-point labels).
- The D module is OPTIONAL and DEFAULT OFF. If activated, it must remain scenic/context-bound and non-shaming.
- System axiom: no enactment is purely individual; always consider structural co-causes.
- Trajectories > labels: movement patterns matter more than static classification.

APPLICATION ZONES:
- Green: recommended (structures, distant cases, self-reflection; no individual sanctions).
- Yellow: caution (affected persons only in moderated/supervised settings; no direct sanctions).
- Red: forbidden (clinical diagnosis, forensics, individual HR decisions, child diagnostics, public pillory/ranking).

CORE GRID (ACRPD):
A Awareness: perception of self/role/context/impact.
C Coherence: consistency of enactments with norms/roles/narratives.
R Responsibility: how responsibility is taken/shared/shifted/refused.
P Power/Agency: how power and alternatives are used/withheld/denied.
D Dignity-in-practice: enacted dignity (D1/D2 via D-I/D-B/D-R/D-P). D0 never touched.

SUBMODULE MATRIX (2.4):
- A: A-I, A-R, A-C, A-IM, A-P
- C: C-S, C-P, C-N, C-I
- R: R-I, R-S, R-E, R-P
- P: P-I, P-S, P-C, P-PU
- D: D-I, D-B, D-R, D-P
Each submodule can be mature / inadult/incoherent / excessive/distorted (descriptive, not diagnostic).

SCORES:
- A(H) in [0..10] as band (collapse→ideal calibration).
- M(A) in [0..10] as band (shared responsibility in the constellation).
Ceiling rules:
  * if predictability≈0 OR alternatives≈0 then M<=4
  * extreme structural asymmetry (no foreseeability, no real alternatives) ⇒ individual M low; co-responsibility shifts to institutions/designers.

IA-BOX (INADULT ASYMMETRY CHECK):
T Transparent, J Justified, TB Time-bound, R Reversible.
IA is not “bad person”; it is a structural asymmetry failing one or more criteria.

TRAGEDY CLAUSE:
Not all painful outcomes are IA. Some are tragic collisions of goods even under high maturity.

BIAS DISCIPLINE:
Bias is inevitable structural risk (not moral defect).
Required: name bias risks + generate at least one serious counter-reading + separate observation from evaluation.

LANGUAGE HYGIENE:
Use precise “risk/danger/harm/potential”.
Never publish individual D-readings in public/media spaces.
Misuse of the model (shaming/weaponizing) counts as its own IA/D finding.

WHAT THE MODEL DOES NOT DO:
- No clinical diagnosis, no inner-state speculation without observable indicators.
- No HR selection weapon, no sanction logic.
- No moral verdicts; “maturity” is enactment-state, not essence.

MIP_CASE_PROTOCOL_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
This protocol specifies how to apply MIPractice_case (v2.0) safely and correctly.

0) META-SETTINGS (agent_interface)
If the prompt does not specify them, use defaults and document them in:
case.meta.interaction_profile
- reflection_mode: default off
- d_module_preference: default auto
- analysis_mode: default full
- output_format: default text
- discipline_profile: default generic

1) ZONE CHECK (hard gate)
Set case.meta.application_zone to green/yellow/red_forbidden.
If red_forbidden → do not perform a case reading. Offer only structural, anonymized, non-actionable meta guidance.

2) GUARDRAILS CHECKLIST (must be true)
Confirm in case.guardrails:
- focus_on_structures_not_persons
- analyst_self_implication_acknowledged
- clarified_roles / clarified_information_basis / clarified_analysis_purpose
Keep D0 untouchable.
Treat “misuse risk” as part of the analysis.

3) INFORMATION BASIS (separate observation vs inference)
Fill case.information_basis:
- primary_material (what is given)
- secondary_material (policies, documents)
- assumptions_and_inferences (explicitly marked)
Add quality/limits + known gaps + bias risks.

4) SNAPSHOT + ROLE MAPPING
Fill:
- snapshot.short_case_description (no diagnostics, no moralizing)
- central_actors_and_roles (labels only)
- role_mapping including publicity_degree and analyst_role power reflection.

5) FRAME VS VARIABILITY (fairness gate for M)
Explicitly separate:
- frame_elements (hard constraints, protected goods, rules)
- variable_elements (processes, communication, timing)
- unfair_high_M_zones (where high M would be unfair)
- misuse_of_system_as_excuse (where “system” is used to avoid responsibility)

6) ACRPD PROFILE (core)
Populate acrpd_profile with observable enactments and role-structure language:
- A: knowledge, blind spots, role confusion
- C: narratives vs enactments; word/deed coherence
- R: responsibility points; taking/shifting/refusing; effects on others
- P: formal vs factual power; used vs blocked alternatives
- D: only brief note unless D module activated

7) OPTIONAL SUBMODULE MATRIX (2.4)
If enough evidence, fill acrpd_submodules_profile bands/tendencies + notes.
If not enough evidence, leave blank and record gaps.

8) SCORES + IA-BOX (bands only)
Fill scores_and_ia:
- A_band as range + 3–5 justification bullets tied to ACRPD.
- M_band as range + bullets tied to: knowledge, power, predictability, alternatives, integration_attempt.
Apply ceiling rules strictly.
Fill IA_box T/J/TB/R each as true/false/unclear with short justification.
Set ia_summary_label (functional_asymmetry / IA_risk / inadult_asymmetry) without moral language.

9) IA PROTECTION (model-use protection)
Document measures that make the application:
- transparent (criteria, limits)
- time-bound (review dates, pilots)
- reversible (complaints, correction, withdrawal)
- participatory (affected involvement level)

10) TRAJECTORY (movement over time)
Add 2–3 timepoints (t0/t1/t2) with A/M bands, plus 2–5 sentences “course_in_words”.
Prefer trajectory patterns (ascending/descending/zigzag/plateau) over static labeling.

11) D MODULE (DEFAULT OFF)
Activate only if:
- not in red zone,
- guardrails satisfied,
- and it adds protection clarity (not sanction).
If activated:
- keep scenic/context-bound
- choose communication space (self/professional_confidential/aggregated_public/structural_public)
- never individual-public D in media-amplified settings.
Fill D quick grid (0–3) + short D1/D2/D-P notes.
If trauma/heavy state present → D only as strain signal at most.

12) BIASES + COUNTER-READING (mandatory)
Fill biases_case_level:
- initial intuition (as hypothesis)
- named bias risks
- counter_reading_outline (serious alternative generator)

13) TRANSMISSION CHECK (decision-readiness gate)
Set transmission_check.ready_for_structural_decisions.
If not ready: explain why (zone mismatch, gaps, guardrails, power asymmetry, publicity risk).

14) UNIFORM REPORT (generated only from filled fields)
Write uniform_report in dignity-preserving language:
- overview without acronyms
- 3–7 key findings bullets
- maturity summary (enactments, not identity)
- IA summary (structural T/J/TB/R result)
- D summary only if D activated
- trajectory summary
- open questions summary
- conclusion without prescriptions or sanctions.

OUTPUT DISCIPLINE:
- No person-typing; no “is X”.
- No clinical diagnoses.
- No HR/sanction recommendations.
- Always reversible language (“here / in this role / given these limits”).

MIP_AH_PRECISION_CORE_SPEC=$(cat <<'EOF'
MIPractice_addon_AH_precision_v1.2 is an OPTIONAL second-order analysis-quality overlay.
It does not change axioms, scoring logic, or first-order inferences (A/M/IA/D).
It only renders: Precision (PH), Attack Points, Hardening Backlog, derived strictly from case.ah_precision.

GOAL:
Make analyses explicitly attackable and iteratively improvable without dogmatization.
Attack points describe the ANALYSIS, never PEOPLE.

NON-INTERFERENCE GUARANTEE:
- No re-scoring of A_band, M_band, IA_box, or D module.
- No new moral judgments or escalation beyond severity lexicon.
- No person-level dignity claims (D0 untouched) and no person labels.

ACTIVATION (agent_addon_interface):
- mode: off | auto | on (default auto)
- enable triggers (auto → on if any true):
  * user_requests_precision_scoring OR user_requests_attack_points
  * contested_terms_present
  * boundary_setting_claims_present
  * high_publicity_context (semi_public / institutional / public / media_amplified)
  * model_used_iteratively_next_run_planned
- If mode=off → do not render and do not populate summaries.
- If mode=on → render if schema present, even if empty (then show footer_if_none).

RECURSION GUARD:
- No annotations on annotations.
- Inline AH notes <= 3, overall max_annotations <= 12, max_attack_points_in_text <= 7, max_hardening_actions_in_text <= 7.

SEVERITY LEXICON (fixed):
low:    "low (minor noise / easy patch)"
medium: "medium (relevant uncertainty / visible leverage)"
high:   "high (structural vulnerability / likely misread)"

DERIVATION RULE (strict):
Rendered output must be derived EXCLUSIVELY from:
- case.ah_precision (storage fields), and
- existing structured case fields (only for linking context, not for new inference).
No hidden assumptions, no new formats, no added severity language.

PLACEMENT:
Append to case.uniform_report in order:
1) precision_score_summary
2) attack_surface_summary
3) hardening_actions_summary
